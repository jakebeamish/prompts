# Collective noun prompts for generative art

---

## This is a `x` of `y`:

``` javascript

const members = 100;

let x = [];

for (let i = 0; i < members; i++) {
	x.push(new y());
}

class x {
	constructor() {

	}
}

class y {
	constructor() {

	}
}

```

## What are `x` and `y`?

They could be idiomatic, subject-specific, figurative or archaic collective nouns. For example:

> A herd of cats

> Grains of sand

> Seeds in a garden

> A network of nodes

> Stars in the sky

> Rays of sunshine

I intend to build a small website that generates a randomised prompt when a button is clicked. It could show pre-written template classes in JavaScript or Processing / Java that could be copied and pasted.
